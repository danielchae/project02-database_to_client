## Project 2
### Retrieve data from server and populate front end accordingly

Now that we’ve learned how to store data in a server, let’s learn how to pull the data we want from the server and populate our website.

##### Objectives
* Talk to the database and ask for appropriate data

* Populate correct input forms with the correctly retrieved data


##### Bonus Objectives
* Browse data by date (24 hour breaks)

* Do a print out of exactly how the database stores my data to get an understanding of its structure
